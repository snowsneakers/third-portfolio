          {"I'm"} Pat, a web developer with a passion for both basketball and
          computers. After completing my undergrad, I coached basketball, but
          the pandemic shut down most leagues. That gave me the opprotunity to
          rediscover my love for computers. {"I've"} grown my skills
          participating in the <span className="font-bold">Collab Lab</span> and
          being a part of the <span className="font-bold">100devs</span>{" "}
          community, shaping me into the developer I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, {"I'm"} fortunate to be pursuing my passion with the{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">Lakers</span> and look forward to more
          opportunities ahead. In my free time, I enjoy making memories with my
          girlfriend, eating yummy food, watching movies from 2008, and hopfully
          winning in Counter-Strike ðŸ˜‚
