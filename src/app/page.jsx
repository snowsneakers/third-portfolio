              {"I'm"} Pat, a web developer who has always had two loves:
              <span className="font-bold">basketball</span> and{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">computers</span>. After completing my
              undergrad, I continued to pursued my passion for basketball by
              working as a coach. Unfortunately, the pandemic forced the
              shutdown of sports leagues, which turned out to be a blessing in
              disguise as it gave me the opportunity to explore my other
              passionâ€”computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then, I have immersed myself in the world of{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">web development</span>. I have created
              websites and applications that I could never have imagined just a
              couple of years ago. Throughout this journey, {"I've"} been
              fortunate to grow my skills with the{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">Collab Lab</span> and the supportive{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">100devs community</span>, both of
              which have played a significant role in shaping me into the
              developer I am today.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to continue <span className="font-bold">learning</span> and{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">building</span>, and {"I'm"} lucky to
              be currently pursuing this passion with the{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">Lakers</span>. {"I'm"} excited to see
              what other opportunities lie ahead in my development journey.
              During my free time, I love creating memories with my girlfriend,
              eating yummy food, watching movies from 2008, and hopefully
              winning in counter-strike ðŸ˜‚
